# BrestCancerClassification

The Neural Network Sequential model classifies the Tumor as Benign or Malignant.

Here, in the model 1 input layer, 1hidden layer and 1 output layer is constructed.

The epoch value is set to 10 and then data is fit into model.

**Loss incurred=13.58% 

Accuracy=96.58%**

Then loss and accuracy is plotted to see the difference between training data and validation data.

After this, a Prediction model is built and checked on a given input to predict the right value.
